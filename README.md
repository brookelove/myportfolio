# Description

Welcome to the bones of my portfolio. I wanted to create a portfolio to showcase my work that I have createds and update. Thisis a place for my apps to show whoi I am, As a full stack developer I have a place for both my front end and back end work lies.

# Motivation

    I wanted to create a new portfolio after completing my bootcamp so I had fgree creativity. It allowed me to showcase what I was and am completing currently. Athough, it seems shoiret time to create a new project even though I made one a few weeks ago I realize that I have grown since then and have become more accomplished in what I created.

# Usage

    I am using this app to provide a quick link to my work and showcase my skillset.
