As I continue to grow this application I want to add more widgets such as a calender that tracts al your monthly meetings that you can add onto.

With technology at our fingertips presents many more opportunities for brides and grooms to have vast access to some of the most expensive items for the wedding, the dress and venue. With all of the opportunities it can be hard to keep track of potential dresses and venues, I created an program in python that allows the user to enter potential venues and dresses that they like and then produces a documented table of all the potential venues for the user to see!",

I believe anyone that is moving from smaller moves from city to city or across the country, to college moves. These people would be benefitted from this.
